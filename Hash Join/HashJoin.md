# Hash Join App
Program written for a Database Management Systems class to preform hash joins on a pair of datasets. The entire program was written using WPF and C#. The app can load two different (or the same, why not) appropriately constructed CSV files and perform the join using any of the columns available on either set. A selectivity indicator at the bottom on the window gives a percentage of how many fields matched and were joined.

| ![The interface of the hash app. The window is dominated by three large, empty tables. The one in the center is slightly smaller to make room for the selectivity indicator at the bottom. All three are empty. Above the right and left tables are buttons to open CSV files to populate the tables. Above the center is a set of controls to select columns from both sets, and a button to commence the join. The middle table is labelled "Join result".](../_DemoImg/hash/init.png) | ![The interface of the hash app. The left table is populated with a small amount of data from "Book5.csv", the right from a file called "Book1.csv". They are joined using column 3 from book 5 and column 1 from book 1. Four tuples are present in the join table, with a selectivity of 19%.](../_DemoImg/hash/1.png) |
